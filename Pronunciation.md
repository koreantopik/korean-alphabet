## Sound Changes and Pronunciation Rules

Hangul pronunciation involves various sound change rules that occur in connected speech. These include:
1. **Batchim Rules**: The final consonant (받침) of a syllable may change depending on the following letter.
2. **Assimilation**: Sounds may combine or adapt to neighboring syllables.
3. **Tensification**: Consonants can become tense after certain sounds.
4. **Elision**: Some sounds may disappear in casual speech.
5. **Linking**: Final consonants may link to vowels in the next syllable.
