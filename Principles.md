# Principles of Hangul

## Scientific Design
Hangul is often praised for its logical structure. The design reflects the shape of the mouth, tongue, and throat when pronouncing each sound.

### Consonants
Consonants are designed based on articulatory phonetics:
- **ㄱ (g)**: Represents the back of the tongue blocking airflow.
- **ㅁ (m)**: Represents the shape of the lips.

### Vowels
Vowels are based on three elements:
- **. (Heaven)**: Represents the sky.
- **ㅡ (Earth)**: Represents the ground.
- **ㅣ (Human)**: Represents a person standing.

### Syllable Blocks
Hangul is written in syllable blocks, each containing a combination of consonants and vowels, e.g., 한 (han).
