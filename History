# History of Hangul

## Introduction
Hangul (한글) was created in 1443 by King Sejong the Great and the scholars of the Jiphyeonjeon (Hall of Worthies). It was officially promulgated in 1446 through a document called the **Hunminjeongeum** (훈민정음), meaning "The Proper Sounds for the Instruction of the People."

## Why was Hangul created?
Before Hangul, Koreans primarily used Chinese characters (Hanja) for writing. However, these characters were difficult for common people to learn. Hangul was designed to be:
- **Simple**: Easy to learn and use.
- **Phonetic**: Represents the sounds of the Korean language.
